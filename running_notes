Gameplan





1. Take in the file
2. Check whether the file is a ISCAS85 or ITC99i (Done)

 How do you do that?
Regex for #c and alphanumeric is iSC85
Regex for # edf2bench v0.8

3. What should be regex pattern logic for each?

If file is ISC85, use Gaurav's logic in PA0b
If file is ITC99 then?
"Unordered maps"
"Strings"

4. What do you need in the graph? Justify each decision you make. You alsh have to think how these will relate to simulated annealing
Create the graph and initialize chip_area = 0
a. Each node should have the fan in and fan out. Strictly define what is the context of these
b. The data structure 
->1. bool assigned or not
->2. x,y coordinates
->3. fan in
->4. Calculate area of gate,store it and add it to initial chip area
For the ISC85, construct the graph as it was in PA1 and for ITC 99 use  a construction ID as you are constructing the graph

Your graph will be Node,<Fan-In-List>
Once the graph is created then, you have a rectangle x units by y units

What is x and y?
Psuedocode for  this step
a/ For ISC 85






b/ For ITC99

5. How should you reason behind the initial random placement
6. Function for calculating the HPWL and doesn't matter in this case inplace implementation would be faster
Not a 1-1 map, first determine the gate type and then the number of inputs

Define your chip data structure
A 2D array of structs

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2329581/c-pointers-how-to-assign-value-to-a-pointer-struct

typedef struct GateLocation
{
   bool occupied = false;
}

ChipHeight number of columns (fixed) 
ChipWidth can change per row

http://csci.viu.ca/~wesselsd/courses/csci160/examples/2darr/index.html

Each element in this matrix should have a flag which says occupied or not,
How do you ensure that there is no overlap

Generate two random construction ids

Legal placement is allowed only if 

all locations in range of (cell1.xcoordinate + widthofcell2) if cell1 is removed are empty

all locations in range of (cell2.xcoordinate + widthofcell1) if cell2 is removed are empty
